# wibu-tools-for-nothing

Small collection of personal utilities. These are lightweight scripts I use to
test camera capture and other small tasks. I'm publishing them here for
convenience — feel free to use or adapt them, but keep in mind they were
primarily written for my own needs and testing environments.

## Included tools

- `fov_test_opencv_gstreamer/` — A small utility to test OpenCV + GStreamer
	camera capture and measure effective FPS across a few resolutions.


## Notes & disclaimers

These are personal tools intended for testing and debugging. Use at your own risk.
